###Nutmeg Javatest

###The aim
Please write a Java command line utility and submit it as a git repository, e.g. a link to a github repo.
The repository should contain instructions on how to compile and run the utility.
The command should have the following interface:
```
$ my_command [ file | categories | fact ]
```

The program should interact with the following public APIs:
* http://thecatapi.com/
* http://catfactsÂ­api.appspot.com/doc.html
The command should:
* file: save an image of a cat to a tmp folder and print the url to stdout
* categories: print an ordered list of cat categories to stdout
* fact: list a cat fact

###Design choices
* Maven: dependency management
* Unirest: simple REST API client
* Gson: Json -> POJO mappings
* Jaxb: XML -> POJO unmarshalling
* Junit: tests

###Build
I've used the maven assembly plugin to keep things simple and build a single JAR with all of the required dependencies:
```
mvn clean compile assembly:single
```

###Run

```
java -jar target/nutmeg-java-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar file
